# NotAgeOfWar

A school C++ project. An other student and myself were ask to develop a game similar to Age Of War but without a graphical interface.

You can try playing the game by downloading the project. I recommend not using the application file, it seems this file does not work well most of the time. Create a C++ project on VSCode for example and launch the last successfull build instead.

You can find the rules of the game in the report, but currently the report is only in french. English version may arrive soon.
